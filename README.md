# C - BINARY TREES

# Project Overview
The project involved learning about binary trees, their details, advantages, and disadvantages. It likely covered concepts like tree traversal and classifying trees.

# Implemented Tree Types 
The project included the implementation of different types of binary trees, including:

Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
AVL Tree
Max Binary Heap Tree
Tests: Test files for the project are provided in the "tests" folder. These tests are used to verify the correctness of the implemented tree structures and associated operations.

# Helper File 
The "binary_tree_print.c" file contains a C function that helps in printing binary trees in a visually organized manner. This can be useful for debugging and visualizing tree structures.

#Header File
The "binary_trees.h" file serves as the header file, which includes definitions and prototypes for all the types and functions developed for the project. This file typically contains function declarations and structure definitions related to binary trees.
